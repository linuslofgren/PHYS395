# Running

Make sure that you execute the program using a Python environment which includes `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
This can be created using
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
```

Output from problem 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be checked using
```bash
python Q1.py
python Q2.py
python Q3.py
python Q4.py
```

and the resulting plots are `Q1.pdf`, `Q2.pdf` and `Q3.pdf`
