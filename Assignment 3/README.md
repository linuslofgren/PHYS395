# Running
The solutions can be run using `main.py`.

Make sure that you execute the program using a Python environment which includes `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
This can be created using
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
```

When ready, make sure the file "periodic.dat" is available in the same directory, and run the program using
```bash
python main.py
```
