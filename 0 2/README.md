# Running
Each problem can be run individually or all at once using `main.py`.

Make sure that you execute the program using a Python environment which includes `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scipy`.
This can be created using
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
```

When ready, run the program using
```bash
python main.py
```

All generated output is located in the `output` directory.
